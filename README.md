**Strength envelopes** is a free, open-source, and cross-platform script to generate lithosphere strength envelopes. The script is primarily intended for educational purposes and producing publication ready plots. The script is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) but does **not require previous knowledge of Python for its use**. The script can be easily adapted for more advanced lithosphere strength modelling if you have programming skills.

## Requirements

Strength envelopes script requires Python 3.5+ and the scientific libraries [*Numpy*](http://www.numpy.org/) and [*Matplotlib*](http://matplotlib.org/). We recommend installing the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) or the [Enthought Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/) Python distributions since both have free basic versions that include the required the scientific packages. TODO - miniconda
