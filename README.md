_This project is maintained by [Marco A. Lopez-Sanchez](https://marcoalopez.github.io/) - Last update: 2020/09/08_

**Strength envelopes** is a pet project consisting of a series of free open-source cross-platform [Jupyter notebooks]() aimed at building lithosphere strength envelopes. The notebooks are primarily intended for educational purposes, especially for hands-on courses, but can be easily adapted for advanced lithosphere strength modelling. The programming language used in the notebooks is [Python](https://www.python.org/), but it does **not require previous Python knowledge for its use**. All the notebooks are intended to be self-explanatory and have a smooth learning curve.

> **Important disclaimer**: The project is currently under development. This is a pet project and thus I develop it at my own pace (i.e. in my spare time).  hope to have most of the notebooks completed by early 2021. Stay tuned.

## Requirements & Installation

_Available soon with detailed instructions_

Strength envelopes script requires Python 3.5+ and the scientific libraries:

[Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
[Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
[IPython]()
TODO

To work locally with the notebooks, I recommend installing the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and using either the Jupyter lab or the notebook.
