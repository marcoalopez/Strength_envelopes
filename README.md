**Strength envelopes** is a free open-source cross-platform script to generate crust and lithosphere strength envelopes. The script is primarily intended for educational purposes and for creating strength envelope plots. The script is written in [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/) but does **not require previous knowledge of Python to its use**. The script can be also used as a base for advanced modelling if you have programming skills.  

**Important note:** The script is currently under development. A beta version and the documentation necessary for its use will be released soon. Stay tuned.
