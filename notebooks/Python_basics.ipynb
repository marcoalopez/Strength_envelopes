    "## 1. What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python](https://www.python.org/) is an _interpreted_, _high-level_, _general-purpose_, _multi-paradigm_ programming language. In a nutshell:\n",
    "- _Interpreted_ means that a sequence of instructions written by the programmer (\"the source code\") is read and executed by an interpreter (i.e. executed immediately without compilation). This allows interactivity that is advantageous for learning and for scientific analysis.\n",
    "- _High-level_ (of abstraction) means that the syntax of thelanguage is designed to be easily understood by humans. Indeed, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability (human-readable code).\n",
    "- _General-purpose_ means that the language is not specifically targeted to numerical computing as for example Fortran, R, Matlab or Julia. In fact, the Python programming language is used indistinctly for Web or Software Development (e.g. Youtube, Reddit, Dropbox...), System Administration, games, etc., and, of course, for Scientific and Numerical computing. \n",
    "- _Multi-paradigm_ means that the language supports different types of programming (declarative, functional, object-oriented, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the Python highlights are:\n",
    "- completely free and open-source programming language,\n",
    "- easy to learn,\n",
    "- widely adopted and with a good balance between cutting-edge and mature scientific libraries (i.e. tested in production for decades and less prone to errors)\n",
    "- Usually well-documented scientific libraries,\n",
    "- its general-purpose nature makes it a very versatile programming language (beyond its use as a scientific tool)."
